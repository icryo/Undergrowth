# Undergrowth

### Undergrowth is a very simple malware POC templating tool. It only supports 128-bit AES encryption at this time and relies on slightly modified public & private shellcode templates. The goal of this project is to collect and quickly compile shellcode invokation methods from a single source of shellcode. Pair with other projects like CrimsonForge for additional evasion.
