# Undergrowth

### Undergrowth is a very simple malware POC templating tool. It only supports simple AES encryption at this time and relies on slightly modified public shellcode templates. The goal of this project is to collect and quickly compile shellcode invokation methods from a single source of shellcode. Pair with other projects like CrimsonForge for additional evasion.
